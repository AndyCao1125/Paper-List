Some personal claims and understandings:
- Self-supervised learning serves as a comprehensive framework for learning representations from unlabeled data. Often considered the 'cake' of machine learning, it can be broadly classified into two paradigms: generative modeling and discriminative modeling. Despite the recent remarkable advancements in generative modeling, which primarily focus on the quality of generation, I continue to perceive the issue through the lens of representation learning.
- Reinforcement learning, robotic manipulation, and computer vision are all intricately connected within the realm of robot learning. While I categorize them as distinct topics, it's worth noting that some papers may be relevant to multiple subjects.
- It's important to recognize that these topics are not mutually exclusive. For instance, visual reinforcement learning combines elements of visual recognition and reinforcement learning. Additionally, self-supervised learning can be found pervading various areas of the machine learning field.
